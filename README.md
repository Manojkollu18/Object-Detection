# üß† Object Detection using YOLOv8

This repository implements **object detection** using the **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once, version 8) deep learning model.  
The project provides a modular and interactive way to detect objects in images, videos, and webcam feeds ‚Äî supporting visualization, file uploads, and saving detection results.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Detection:** Run YOLOv8 on live webcam input  
- **Batch Image Processing:** Detect objects in multiple uploaded images  
- **Result Visualization:** Bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores  
- **Custom Model Support:** Use pretrained YOLOv8 weights or custom-trained models  
- **Save Outputs:** Automatically saves annotated images with detection results  
- **Interactive Interface:** Easy-to-use functions for flexible experimentation

## üß© Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

## How to Run
1Ô∏è Run Object Detection on an Image  
2 Run Real-time Detection with Webcam  
3 Use the Interactive Interface  

```
python Start_object_detection.py
python Webcam.py
python Main_interactive_interface.py
```
