# ðŸ§  Object Detection using YOLOv8

This repository implements **object detection** using the **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once, version 8) deep learning model.  
The project provides a modular and interactive way to detect objects in images, videos, and webcam feeds â€” supporting visualization, file uploads, and saving detection results.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-time Detection:** Run YOLOv8 on live webcam input  
- **Batch Image Processing:** Detect objects in multiple uploaded images  
- **Result Visualization:** Bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores  
- **Custom Model Support:** Use pretrained YOLOv8 weights or custom-trained models  
- **Save Outputs:** Automatically saves annotated images with detection results  
- **Interactive Interface:** Easy-to-use functions for flexible experimentation
